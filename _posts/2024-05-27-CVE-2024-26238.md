hello, long time no see. today i will show you the new CVE-2024-26238, about the LPE **(Local Privilege Escalation)** but to the next level. the vulnerability uses the **StorSvc** which is a service that operates under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. When the `SvcRebootToFlashingMode` RPC method is invoked locally, **StorSvc** attempts to load the missing **SprintCSP.dll** DLL.

[official repo](https://github.com/blackarrowsec/redteam-research/tree/master/LPE%20via%20StorSvc)

# description


The RPC method `StorSvc.dll!SvcRebootToFlashingMode` invokes `StorSvc.dll!InitResetPhone`, which in turn calls `StorSvc.dll!ResetPhoneWorkerCallback`. This sequence attempts to load **SprintCSP.dll**, as illustrated in the image below:

![facreset](FactoryResetUICC.png)

Since this DLL is missing, it follows the **DLL Search Order** flow for loading. This behavior can be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a writable folder within the `SYSTEM %PATH%.` Consequently, the malicious DLL will be executed with **SYSTEM privileges.**

It is worth noting that the service runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM within the service group LocalSystemNetworkRestricted, which has the following privileges:

```
Privilege Name               Description                                         State       
============================ =================================================== =============
SeTcbPrivilege               Act as part of the operating system                 Enabled   
SeLoadDriverPrivilege        Load and unload device drivers                      Disabled
SeBackupPrivilege            Back up files and directories                       Disabled
SeRestorePrivilege           Restore files and directories                       Disabled
SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege Modify firmware environment values                  Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege      Bypass traverse checking                            Enabled   
SeManageVolumePrivilege      Perform volume maintenance tasks                    Enabled   
```


The command line corresponding to this service is:

```
C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted -p -s StorSvc
```

# poc

the official repo will provide 2 different source codes:

* **RpcClient.exe**: the executable that triggers the RPC call.
* **SprintCSP.dll**: which can be placed to exploit the DLL Hijacking. 

## steps

first of all, download all the repo, and then move the folder named **LPE via StorSvc**

![1](1.png)

open the folder **SprintCSP** folder, and then the **SprintCSP.sln** with **Visual Studio.**

![2](2.png)

open the **main.c** which contains all the code to be builded.

![2](3.png)

go to [revshells](https://revshells.com) and generate your payload this way

![1](4.1.png)

modify the part of the **DoStuff()** function of the command.  leave the `/C`. 

![1](4.2.png)

go to **Build -> Build Solution**

![1](5.png)

check the compile success

![1](6.png)

the build will leave you the **SprintCSP.dll**

![1](7.png)

we need to put the **.dll** in a `%PATH%` folder, to see them run this command:

```powershell
reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" -v Path
```

![1](8.png)

the output will show the folders in `%PATH%`. select one, i'll use the WinRAR folder.

put the .dll in the folder

![1](10.png)

now, open the **RpcClient.sln** project

![1](11.png)

modify the **storsvc_c.c** that will tell the compilator which OS will run the payload

![1](13.png)

select any of those. i'm using a Windows Server 2022

![1](14.png)

let's build


![1](15.png)

the output of the build will give you a .exe. let's run it

![1](17.png)

put you in listening mode with **nc** and you will have a shell.
